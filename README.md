This repository demonstrates Pixeebot's ability to update Python projects that use Poetry as a package manager. It uses a GitHub action to update the `poetry.lock` file after Pixeebot has created a pull request.

See the [documentation](https://docs.pixee.ai/configuring/#python-poetry) for additional details.
